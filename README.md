This program will search for words and or sentences that you type in to see if it matches a certain word or sentence. Once it finds a match it will backspace the length of the sentence or word you typed, and replace it with the better alt. Intention: To prevent people getting banned/muted for typing in words that will get them in that sticky situation.
